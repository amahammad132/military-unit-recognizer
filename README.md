# CV-FS
## The future of AI in War
Our project distinguishes a soldier or military combatant from civilians using Machine Learning in order to minimize civilian casualties during war. Since most military personel have a flag of their nation on their arm, our software searches for a flag and if none it stands down.

## Usage

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
